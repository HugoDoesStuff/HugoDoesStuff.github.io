<h2 style= "font-family:serif;font-style:italic;">Today we started to learn more about electricity and how it works. Electricity has parts such as amperes, voltage, and currents.</h2>

<h2 style= "font-family:serif;font-style:italic;">Today we programmed our robots to move and do other stuff such as turning once it gets close to another object. The robot was built yesterday and was made using screws that were way too small and nuts. The whole robot is controlled by an Arduino which is programmed by files that Diana gave to us. Our goal was to be able to add certain functions onto our robot which was not as bad as I thought it would be. The main and most annoying issue is that one of the motors refuses to work properly. It keeps turning and using less/more power every time the program resets. It went backwards perfectly, but when it came to moving forward, it became such a disaster. Something has to be wrong with one of the motors which sucks because we can't really do anything about that.<h3>
